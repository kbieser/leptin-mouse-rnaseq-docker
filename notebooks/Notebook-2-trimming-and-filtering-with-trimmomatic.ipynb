    "- `-threads` - Number of CPUs (8) to use to complete this analysis (we can adjust this number up or down depending on how powerful our computer is - a higher number will allow the analysis to go faster - if you don't know how many you have don't worry-  the program will just use what is available)\n",
    "- `SLIDINGWINDOW:i:j` - Take the average quality of i (a number we choose) reads and trim if the average is below j (another number we choose)\n",

For each read, start at the begining of the read and take the average Phred quality score of the first 4 bases. If that average is 20 or more, move down and take the average of the next four; repeat this process until the end of the read, but if you hit a spot where the average is less than 20, trim the read there. Finally, after the SLIDINGWINDOW trim is done check to make sure the trimmed read is 75 nucleotides or longer, if it is not, delete the read from my data (I'm only interested in longer reads). "
